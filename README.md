# rdf-explorer

This project helps to visualize and explore geospatially-enabled RDF datasets as both a map and a graph. Context-specific usecases are enabled via easily embedded SPARQL queries. This widget is designed to be a re-usable piece of technology which can be embedded into existing geospatial data managers.

This project was developed by TerraFrame and funded by the U.S. Army Core of Engineers (USACE) and is made available to the public free of charge and licensed under MIT.
